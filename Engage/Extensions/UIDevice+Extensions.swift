             * a bit of a chicken and egg problem in that we only want to allow landscape on "plus" phones but we
             * don't know it is a "plus" phone until after the rotation has occured.

             * The less than ideal solution is to look at the screen size to determine this.  I would call this a
             * "brittle" solution but unfortunately it seems to be the best we have as Apple does not give us any
             * other alternative.
